## Config Command
#### Permission level:
Guild Master Only
#### Aliases:
`Config, Bot`
#### Usage:
Before getting into the main commands, I'll cover the config command as it has many parts.<br/>
The Config command is used to set, edit or remove certain configuration settings.

Within config you can see the settings you have by doing `!config <setting>`<br/>
Example, `!config prefix` would result in the current prefix set for the guild.

You can change a setting by doing `!config set <setting> < New Setting >`<br/>
Example, `!config set prefix &&` would set the guilds prefix to '&&'

You can delete or reset a setting by doing `!config delete <setting>`<br/>
Example, `!config delete prefix` would reset the guilds prefix back to '!'
